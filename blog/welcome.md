Welcome to my personal website! I've just set this up as a space to share my thoughts, projects, and things I'm learning.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will feature posts about:
- **Technology** - Tools, frameworks, and interesting discoveries
- **Projects** - Things I'm building and working on
- **Learnings** - Lessons from my journey in tech and life

## How It Works

This site is built with [11ty (Eleventy)](https://www.11ty.io/), a simple static site generator. Each blog post is a Markdown file in the `blog/` folder, and 11ty automatically generates the HTML.

I can just drop a new `.md` file in the blog folder, add some front matter (title, date, excerpt), and boom - new blog post!

## Coming Soon

I'm planning to write about my adventures with automation, home server setup, and maybe some AI experiments. Stay tuned!

Thanks for stopping by. 👋
