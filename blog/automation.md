excerpt: Discovering how small automations can save time and reduce repetitive tasks in daily life.
---

I've been diving deep into automation lately, and it's amazing how much time you can save with just a few simple scripts and tools.

## Why Automate?

The goal isn't to automate everything - it's to automate the boring, repetitive stuff so you can focus on what matters. Here are some things I've automated:

### Daily Tasks
- **Weather updates** - Get weather forecasts without checking apps
- **Calendar summaries** - Daily briefing of upcoming events
- **System monitoring** - Keep an eye on server health

### Development Workflow
- **Deployment scripts** - One-command deployments
- **Testing** - Automated test runs on commit
- **Documentation** - Generate docs from code comments

## Tools I'm Using

- **Clawdbot** - Personal assistant for automating tasks
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipelines
- **Shell scripts** - Quick system automation
- **Node.js** - More complex automation logic

## Small Wins

The biggest impact has come from small automations - things that save 5-10 minutes a day. They add up!

## Next Steps

I'm planning to explore more home automation and maybe set up some smart home integrations. The key is to start small and iterate.
